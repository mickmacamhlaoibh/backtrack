  The board state is a 4 element tuple.
  The first element is the size of the board. 
  The second element is the remaining moves to be tried from
  the current square - each move is an x y tuple.
  The third element is the current ssquare as a row column tuple.
  The fourth element is a list of squares visited so far
  as a list of row column tuples.

{- Try to do a complete tour of an n x n chessboard with
   a knight visiting each square only once.
   Return a Bool to indicate whether we succeeded and
   the resulting list of squares visited in the order they
   were visited.
   Use the generic back tracking strategy contained 
   within the backTrack function of the BackTrack type class.
   To do this we need to implement the other functions in the 
   BT type class by creating an Instance of it - see below.
    To start with we have 
    A) the size of the board
    B) the listof moves for the first square
    C) the top left square as the starting position
    D) no squares visited ao far
    Then we use the backTrack function in the BackTrack 
    type class to find a solution
    PS if I don't include the BoardState type annotation Haskell
    gets confused
